	<string>Welcome Commander! Soldiers are waiting for you..</string>
	<key>guide1_1</key>
	<string>This is your new Base, your responsibility is to defend the base at all cost.</string>
	<key>guide1_2</key>
	<string>Aieeie, what is this! Another puny army!</string>
	<key>guide2_0</key>
	<string>Enemy is coming. Don&apos;t panic, let&apos;s set up a MG Turret to defend the Base.</string>
	<key>guide2_1</key>
	<string>Place the MG Turret in the center of the Base. We must protect the Headquarter.</string>
	<key>guide3_0</key>
	<string>Speed is everything. Spend some gems to speed things up.</string>
	<key>guide3_1</key>
	<string>Aieeie, there they are! Attack!</string>
	<key>guide3_2</key>
	<string>Great defense! Thanks Commander!</string>
	<key>guide3_3</key>
	<string>Don&apos;t worry commander! The MG Turret will be repaired over time. You need to pay attention to more important things.</string>
	<key>guide4_0</key>
	<string>We have someone here to help us! Let&apos;s take out the Enemy camp! </string>
	<key>guide4_1</key>
	<string>Tap multiple times in an empty area to deploy your troops.</string>
	<key>guide4_2</key>
	<string>Good job, soldier! Now we need to get this Base into fighting shape.</string>
	<key>guide5_0</key>
	<string>Hiring a second worker will let you start two constructions simultaneously.</string>
	<key>guide6_0</key>
	<string>Fuel is essential for modern warfare, keep it coming.</string>
	<key>guide6_1</key>
	<string>Build the fuel refinery and keep producing fuel. Let&apos;s try it!</string>
	<key>guide7_0</key>
	<string>The oil refinery can only store a small amount of fuel.</string>
	<key>guide7_1</key>
	<string>Letâ€™s build a Fuel Depot, so we can stockpile the fuel!</string>
	<key>guide8_0</key>
	<string>We also need a safe place to store our gold.</string>
	<key>guide8_1</key>
	<string>We will take all your gold!!! Watch ...</string>
	<key>guide9_0</key>
	<string>Commander, we need more soldiers to fight those enemies! Let&apos;s build a barrack.</string>
	<key>guide10_0</key>
	<string>Now let&apos;s train some troops!</string>
	<key>guide11_0</key>
	<string>Well done. How about teaching them a lesson again?</string>
	<key>guide11_1</key>
	<string>You can deploy multiple troops by holding down your finger.</string>
	<key>guide12_0</key>
	<string>That was a great battle. My name is ...</string>
	<key>guide13_0</key>
	<string>With the gold we took from the enemies, we now can upgrade the Headquarter.</string>
	<key>guide13_1</key>
	<string>Good job! We can now build new buildings thanks to the Headquarter upgrade.</string>
	<key>guide14_0</key>
	<string>If you&apos;re looking for new challenges to beat, just &apos;tapping&apos; ME.</string>
